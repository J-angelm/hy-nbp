# N Body Problem API
#### *An easy implementation of the N Body Problem of Celestial Mechanics*

### Features
- Create *Bodies* with 3 initial parameters:
  param  |  dtype  |  description
  ------ | --------- | ---------
  *mass* | **float** | mass of the body
  *pos* | **np.array** | position vector <i, j, k> 
  *vel*    | **np.array** | scape velocity vector <i, j, k>
  
- Create an *NBPSolver* with two parameters:
  param  |  dtype  |  description
  ------ | --------- | ---------
  *bodies* | **list** | list of bodies
  *ts*     | **float**       | time step 
    
Utilize the NBPSolver method **_solve_timestep_** to update each body's position after the specified time step has passed.

This package offers flexibility in terms of handling the output, as well as dinamically adding or removing bodies during run time.

### TODO:
  - Add different integration methods
  - Add test cases
  - Add efficiency monitoring
